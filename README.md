# godot-freeform-physics
A Sonic-like physics engine in Godot!

It has a demo level (level1.gd) as well as a semi-function level editor (World.gd)

This project uses the SmartShape2D addon to create the curved level terrain,
as well a modified version of Miles Turin's destructible terrain library
for the level editor https://github.com/milesturin/Godot-Destructable-Terrain
